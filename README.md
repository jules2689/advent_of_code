[This is Advent of Code.](http://adventofcode.com/)

Taking a snippet from the website...

> Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.

To Run
===
1. run `./2015/play.rb`
2. To restrict to a day, add `Day#` where # is the day to which you would like to restrict the answer.
